                            Born and raised within a small town in Georgia and gifted with a powerful drive and an inquisitive mindset.
                            Not knowing where these gifts would lead me, I pursued many interests until fate lead me to Computers. 
                            My first experience was with Game Development and unfortunately due to my lack of experience and knowledge, I failed.
                            Unknowingly, I found this failure as the spark needed to ignite the passion I now have for Computer Science. 
                            I worked for 1yr independently on a simple racing game with no computer experience or a firm understanding of the fundamental 
                            concepts of any subjects involved. Nearing completion the  computer I was working on failed on me and all progression was lost.
                            I was down but not out. 
                        </p>
                        <P>
                            Currently a Chemistry Major my I could not get my mind off of the outcome of the project. Not because it failed but what could 
                            I have done to better my experience. One day I met a Computer Science Professor, Denis Masters whom open the door to the answers I seeked.
                            When we first met I talked about my project and the objectives that I wanted to accomplish. He spoke of the wonders of Computer Science and with my drive 
                            I would find the correct path. This inspired me, I Changed my major and the real journey began.
