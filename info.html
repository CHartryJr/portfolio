                            Born and raised in Milledgeville Georgia and gifted with a powerful drive and an inquisitive mindset.
                            Not knowing where these gifts would lead me, I pursued many interests until fate lead me to Computers. 
                            My first experience was with Game Development and unfortunately due to my lack of experience and knowledge, I failed.
                            Unknowingly, I found this failure as the spark needed to ignite the passion I now have for Computer Science. 
                            I worked for 1yr independently on a simple racing game with no computer experience or a firm understanding of the fundamental 
                            concepts of any subjects involved. Nearing completion the  computer I was working on failed on me and all progression was lost.
                            I was down but not out. 
                        </p>
                        <P>
                            The thought  of the outcome of the project haunted me. Not because it failed, but what could I have done to better my experience? 
                            One day I met a Computer Science Professor, Denis Masters whom open the door to the answers I seeked.
                            When we first met I talked about my project and the objectives that I wanted to accomplish. He spoke of the wonders of Computer Science and with my drive 
                            I would find the correct path. This inspired me, I Changed my major and the real journey began. From Georgia Military College to Georgia College and State 
                            University I have faced many exciting and tedious challeges gaining unmeasurable amounts of knowledge about preperation,foucusing, and most importantaly computers.
                            My interests had grown, giving me a whole new world to look forward to.

                        My journey to becoming as a CS Major has been both challenging and rewarding.
                            During my first year as a Computer Science Major, I faced numerous hurdles as I struggled to grasp the fundamental concepts of programming and computer systems.
                            However, with the support of patient professors and dedicated classmates, I gradually began to build my understanding of coding languages like Python and Java.
                            As I progressed through the CS program, I participated in various extracurricular activities,and coding clubs to enhance my skills and broaden my horizons. 
                            I found mentors who guided me through complex topics like data structures, algorithms, and software engineering practices.
                            In my junior year, I got my first taste of machine learning and data analysis, which captivated me with its potential to solve real-world problems. Despite being intimidated at first,
                            I dove into online courses and personal projects to explore this exciting domain.
                            I also dabbled in web development, learning about front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end technologies like Node.js and databases.

                            Throughout this journey, I faced moments of self-doubt, but I persevered, knowing that with hard work and determination, I could overcome any obstacle. Now, as a senior CS Major,
                            I am amazed at how far I've come, and I am proud of the progress I've made in honing my computer science skills.
                            Looking ahead, I'm excited to apply my knowledge in the real world, contribute to innovative projects, and continue learning and growing in the dynamic field of computer science. 
                            I hope to make a positive impact on society through technology and inspire others from small towns like mine to pursue their dreams in the world of computer science.

                            As a student from a small town in Georgia with little computer experience, my journey to becoming a senior CS Major has been both challenging and rewarding. I have 
                            gathered some very useful key competencies that I know will be helpful to any business I communication skills, Problem-Solving,Critical Thinking,Adaptability, and Persistence
                            Initially, I had limited exposure to computers, but my curiosity and fascination with technology drove me to pursue a degree in computer science.
